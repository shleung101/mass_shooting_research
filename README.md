# Mass Shooting Research


### Things I Learned

Data/SQL
* If possible and convenient, clean the data in Excel first
* Be more organized with how you store data 

General
* Create an **even** clearer outline and objective before starting
    *  Visualize your end product 
       * Don't need to follow through, but better than being lost  

Tableau
*  Use containers on Tableau!!
*  Get feedback for outside perspective
